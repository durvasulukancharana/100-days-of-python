elif Physics>35:
    count+=1
if Chemistry>35:
    count+=1

if count==3:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('noo')


# 8. Student Pass if Passed Any One Subject (>= 35)
# Question: Check if the student passed at least one subject. Explanation: Use logical OR to check if any one subject has marks >= 35. - Input: Maths = 20, Physics = 38, Chemistry = 25 - Output: Pass

Maths = int(input('enter marks'))
Physics = int(input('enter marks'))
Chemistry = int(input('enter marks'))
count=0
if Maths>35:
    count+=1
elif Physics>35:
    count+=1
if Chemistry>35:
    count+=1

if count>=1:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('noo')


# 9. Student Pass if Passed Any Two Subjects
# Question: Check if the student passed any two out of three subjects. Explanation: Use a counter or logical conditions to verify two subjects >= 35. - Input: Maths = 40, Physics = 20, Chemistry = 36 - Output: Pass

maths=int(input('enter a num : '))
physics=int(input('enter a num : '))
chemistry=int(input('enter a num : '))
count=0
if maths>=35:
    count+=1
if physics>=35:
    count+=1
if chemistry>=35:
    count+=1
if count>=2:
    print('pass')
else:
    print('fail')

# 10. Biggest Among Three Numbers
# Question: Find the biggest number among three. Explanation: Compare each pair of numbers using if-else conditions. - Input: A = 7, B = 4, C = 9 - Output: Biggest is: 9

x,y,z=5,3,7
if x>y and x>z:
    print(x)
elif y>x and y>z:
    print(y)
else:
    print(z)


# 11. Smallest Among Three Numbers
# Question: Find the smallest number among three. Explanation: Use comparison logic to determine the minimum value. - Input: A = 7, B = 4, C = 9 - Output: Smallest is: 4

x,y,z=5,3,7
if x<y and x<z:
    print(x)
elif y<x and y<z:
    print(y)
else:
    print(z)


# 12. Perfect Square or Not
# Question: Check if a number is a perfect square. Explanation: A number is a perfect square if the square of its square root equals the number. - Input: Number = 49 - Output: Perfect square

num=25
sqrt=int(num**0.5)
if sqrt**2==num:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')


# 13. Cars Required for Members (Max 5 per car)
# Question: Calculate how many cars are needed for a given number of people. Explanation: Divide total people by 5 and round up using ceiling logic. - Input: Members = 17 - Output: Cars needed = 4

persons=26
